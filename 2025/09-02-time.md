# Time is strange.

Things are happening now, but then they won't be happening anymore.

I am writing this now, but then I won't be writing this.

Why am I observing this time, but not any other time?

Why experience anything if you won't be experiencing it?

How can weeks, then years pass by so fast?

I thought about writing this in the past week.
