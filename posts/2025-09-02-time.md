# Time is strange.

Things are happening now, but then they won't be happening anymore.

I am writing this now (Tue, Sep 2, 2025, 4:23 PM PDT), but then I won't be writing this.

Why am I observing this time, but not any other time?

Why create anything if they will be gone in the future? How could anyone let things from the past be lost? So many things, lost in time.

Why experience anything if you won't be experiencing it?

How can weeks, then years pass by so fast?

So many awesome things happened years ago, but they are over.

I thought about writing this in the past week.
