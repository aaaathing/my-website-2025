# Hello

Hello. This is my new website.

Here is a background:

## What happened
</summary>

Sat, Apr 26, 2025, 10 am: I found out that the website had went down. It failed to redeploy because it got stuck.  
<span style="opacity:0.5">Apr 26, 2025: I thought about adding a graph database to my website on the new server. It seemed awesome and would allow so many more things (paginating posts, finding posts by user, finding other things, search text).</span>

<span style="opacity:0.5">For many days, I tried moving my website to the VPS, and wrote code for new databases (LMDB, LevelDB (update old code)).</span>

Thu, May 1, 2025: I made my website static. <span style="opacity:0.5">"I don't want to worry anymore about what happens on the website and keeping it up and making back ups." I wanted to be free from it.</span>

Mon, May 5, 2025, 2:43 pm to 6:28 pm: I split the server and posts and users and other dynamic stuff from the main website, and called it websitecontent.

May 8, 2025: I decided to shut it down if nothing happens at end of week.  

May 11, 2025: I shut down websitecontent.

Jul 1, 2025: The database was uploaded.
