# Hello

Hello. This is my new website.

#### Why did I start a new website?

The posts, maps, accounts, and others on the old website (thingmaker.us.eu.org) were shut down.

Also, there were a lot of old things I made on the old website. It seemed too messy to add more to it. The old website is basically like an archive now.

From Sat, Apr 26, 2025 to May 11, 2025, I thought and worried about what to do about the website and the posts and maps and more on it.<br><br>
On Thu, May 1, 2025, I made my website static. "I don't want to worry anymore about what happens on the website and keeping it up and making back ups." I wanted to be free from it. <img title="aHR0cHM6Ly9kcml2ZS5nb29nbGUuY29tL2RyaXZlL2ZvbGRlcnMv 1l0Cf7zBVxgkA2XFbTz-6d83iygsyhhkM">
